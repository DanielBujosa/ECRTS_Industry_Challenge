# TSN Configuration and Reconfiguration Tools ‚Äì Industry Challenge

This repository contains the tools, scripts, and experimental results developed for the Industry Challenge case study. It focuses on the configuration and reconfiguration of a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) system under both normal and fault conditions.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

### üîß Configuration

This folder includes the tools used to perform the initial configuration of the network, as well as the results of each analysis and iteration.

Contents:
- **Experiment0.X** (4 folders): Analysis of the initial configuration provided in the Industry Challenge.
- **Experiment1.X** (3 folders): Results of the three iterations used to determine AVB traffic priority mapping.
- **TSN_Streams.txt**: Stream definitions for the case study.
- **ECRTSICreader.m**: MATLAB script that parses `TSN_Streams.txt`, classifies the traffic, and generates the input for the ST scheduler.
- **TSN_HeuristicScheduler.exe**: Executable for generating the ST schedule.
- **AVB_analysis_input_generator.m**: MATLAB script to generate the input for the AVB WCRTA analysis.
- **AVB_analysis.exe**: WCRTA analysis executable.
- **test0.bat**: Windows batch script to run the full configuration process.

### üîÅ Reconfiguration

This folder contains the tools and results related to evaluating the system under link failure scenarios.

Contents:
- **Experiment1** to **Experiment8**: Each folder corresponds to a different link failure.
- **TSN_Streams.txt**: Same stream definition file used in configuration.
- **ECRTSICreaderLoop.m**: MATLAB script that generates all eight failure scenarios, calculates alternative paths, maps traffic classes, and creates inputs for the ST scheduler.
- **TSN_HeuristicScheduler.exe**, **AVB_analysis_input_generator.m**, and **AVB_analysis.exe**: Same tools as in the configuration phase.
- **test.bat**: Windows batch script to execute all reconfiguration experiments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- MATLAB R2019a or later
- Windows OS (for `.bat` script execution)
